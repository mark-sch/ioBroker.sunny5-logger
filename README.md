## sunny5-logger adapter for ioBroker

Connect to photovotaic inverters, read data, publish to mqtt and store solar data to json file.

Sunny5/Luxpower is connected by mqtt
Solis 4G is connected by modbus rs485
SMA Tripower is connected by modbus tcp
PowerOne/ABB is connected by modbus rs485

### Test the adapter manually on a local ioBroker installation
In order to install the adapter locally without publishing, the following steps are recommended:
1. Create a tarball from your dev directory:  
	```bash
	npm pack
	```
1. Upload the resulting file to your ioBroker host
1. Install it locally (The paths are different on Windows):
	```bash
	cd /opt/iobroker
	npm i /path/to/tarball.tgz
	```

For later updates, the above procedure is not necessary. Just do the following:
1. Overwrite the changed files in the adapter directory (`/opt/iobroker/node_modules/iobroker.sunny5-logger`)
1. Execute `iobroker upload sunny5-logger` on the ioBroker host
